# TF2Settings
Config files for the game TF2

## Simplified branch purpose
After getting accused of hacking one too many times I started to think that maybe
my TF2 config had some unfair advantages that was giving me an edge somehow.

I have only ever been a pubber and was only dimly aware of the competitive scene.
But one thing I knew is that the competitive scene had some rules about your config
because there are ways of setting the game up that will give you an advantage that
is more than just a little unfair for those who don't set up their game in this way.

But not being part of the competitive scene I have no idea what these settings might
be, and have been haphazardly modifing my config however I felt like.

Merging Chris's config with Comanglia's only to move onto Mastercom's and mixing
all of those with TF2-Easyscripting by FancyBanana as well as using scripts to
make rocket jumping easier or scout jumping easier.

So for all I knew I had some monstrosity that was giving me all sorts of advantages
that I just haven't bothered to think about.

So now in order to play fair I have pared back all my custom files and config files
down to the bare basics that still feel correct for me without relying on unfair
scripts like rocket jumping or anything else like that. (I mean somethings are still
unfair, but I can't play without them yet. baby steps)

# disclaimer
I've never crossed the line into installing hacks that modify ram or program files
the unfair things I'm talking about are just config files that lower game details
or the vpks that mastercomfig have on their site to disable footsteps or ambient
sounds or make weapons transparent (which is unfair because now I can actually 
see the battle field, while by default TF2 doesn't allow this. and so most players 
just deal with what TF2 gives them, but *noooo* I've got to be all unfair and 
improve my visual field. heck I even use 90 fov, guys. that ain't default.
